Full stack Development
----------------------

combination of backend and frontend
-----------------------------------

Language
--------
it is a way of communication.
suppose if we need to comminicate with computer then what we have to do
we should use programing language

what is programing language?
communicating with computer system
so,you might have researched with many PL in udemy,youtube and from friends and family memebers 
shall we list some them
1)python
2)java
3)sql
4)ruby
5)c#
--when we are listing pl language.i got some doubt so,there might be how many PL.
(There are morethan 3k then how do we choose the PL to learn based on the scope)
--And which was the first PL launched to know this we should under the next concept i.e evolulation of PL

Evolution of PL
----------------
--Go to google and search for that(Evolution of programming languages)
--i think now we can understand something from that picture we can understand what was the first
programming language

1)Machine level language
what language does a system understand i.e 0's and 1's
--specially designed for machine understanding
--we were able to perform basic calculation 
--even addition was 1+2= one in binary + in binary and 2 in binary
2)Assembly level language
--its a low level language
--it was designed for human understanding purpose
--example: 2 add 3 now we can see both num and alphabets so how to system understand
now we need a translator and that translator is called assembler
Assembler is something which converts lll into mll
3)High level language
--it was designed for human understanding
--And the popular programming language is C,COBOL AND FORTRAIN
--so 'C' is called actually midddle level language why?
--it has features of high level language features and low level language features 
i.e pointing
directly to the system memory with pointers
--it is called mother of many PL.why?
--example we will go to ATM so in order with withdraw what is the condition
this conditions are first desgined in c then used by other programming language
4)OOPS(object oriented programming language)
--what is oops?take sometime and revert backend
--using oops we can solve real-world problems(or)we can deal with real world objects
(or)we can solve day to day life problems
--lets take one example
10years ago there was no zomato
what is the problem statement?
what we were doing?
--go to restraunt
--check the menu
--place the order
--payment
--wait and collect
we cannot solve this without oops 
--shall we list some application
zomato,swiggy and uber
--what happens when we start youtube we will not come out of that very quickly right 
because application is designed 
in that way so that will be next evolution
--A.I(Artifical intelligence)
what it does?
if you consider zomato,uber will we uninstall once we are done so what we are discussing 
its not about
PL its about application.then what is application?
what is software?
--Desktop application
	--Notepad,msoffice
	adv
	--we dont need internet
	disav
	--it doesnt work without internet
	--stand alone application
--web application
	-- Facbook,instagram,excel....
	--static  and  dynamic
	exceler			--instagram,ticket booking
	where everyone will have samething
	--single page application and multiple application

--we can create a responsive webpage
what is responsive website
--so,now i want to make an application like flipkart,Amazon
--just now we listed some application what might be required.we will be using this

Architechture of fullstack
---------------------------
1)Frontend
2)Backend
3)Database
so,what is frontend,backend and database
frontend
--presentation layer
--what user sees

backend
--supposse  if you have clicked on buying a ticket.you cant right way go buy we have to do some calculation to check
whether the avaliablity is there or not
--so what i mean to say is we check business logic
--to store all the data we need database

so,what are the programming languages we have in frontend and backend
--html
--css
--js
--bootstrap
--react
--angular

backend
--core java[j2sc]
write the architecture and show
